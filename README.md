REST API for managing users

## Considerations
- Java version: 17
- Spring Boot version: 2.5.5
- Database: H2
- Build tool: Gradle
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
- Postman collection: [here](https://api.postman.com/collections/1052400-b21c6764-d2cc-4d55-805f-5e980f0cce38?access_key=PMAT-01JA12VSKK3988D7CMB13KVGGF)
- I didn't implement validation for the fields, but it's a good practice to do it
- UserService class should also have a unit test class
- More edge cases should be tested
